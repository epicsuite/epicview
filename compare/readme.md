### The EPIC project

Broad knowledge of epigenetic regulation of host-pathogen interactions would greatly advance
our ability to predict pathogens that have high potential to cause the next global scale catastrophe or
pandemic. Although recent progress has been made, scientists and decision makers currently lack methods
to quickly compare and identify pathogen-induced changes to host genomes to understand susceptibility
and resiliency. This repository includes the toolset developed to address the analysis and visualization 
needs for extreme scale epigenetics data.
